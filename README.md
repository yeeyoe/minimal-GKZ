1. mGKZ.ipynb is Jupyter Notebook file. Input a point-configuration 'A'. Output minimal GKZ vector 'mGKZ'. 
Requirements: Sagemath 10.5 + Jupyter Notebook

2. mGKZ(fraction+Mathematica).ipynb relies on the symbolic computation of Mathmematica. It can output the exact fraction minimal GKZ vector.
Run it at first, and then run nearest-point(Mathematica).nb in Mathematica. 
Requirements: Sagemath 10.5 + Jupyter Notebook + Mathematica

Limited by the algorithm of .secondary_polytope() in Sagemath. The number of points can not exceed 15 (maybe).
